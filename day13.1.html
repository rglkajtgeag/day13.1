    <h1 style="background-color: beige;">rasam</h1>
    <p>Rasam is a spicy South Indian soup-like dish.[1] It is usually served as a side dish with rice. In a traditional South Indian meal, it is part of a course that includes sambar rice. Rasam has a distinct taste in comparison to sambar due to its own seasoning ingredients and is fluid in consistency. </p>
    <h1 style="background-color: blanchedalmond;">sambar</h1>
    <p>Sambar is a lentil-based vegetable stew, cooked with pigeon pea and tamarind broth. It originates from South Indian cuisine and is now popular in large parts of India and beyond. The stew is similar to another Burmese cuisine dish used as a popular accompaniment to Burmese curries.</p>
    <h1 style="background-color: antiquewhite;">chicken fry</h1>
    <p>Chickens belonging to the same age cohort and sex are often kept together in industrial production settings. The pecking order is established within groups of female chicks by the 10th week of life. In groups of male chicks, however, fights for dominance may continue into adulthood. </p>
